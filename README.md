This project involved developing a machine learning model to predict real estate prices by cleaning and processing over 13,000 data points. The approach included applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables and using K-fold cross-validation to ensure robust model performance. To enhance model accuracy, GridSearchCV was utilized for optimizing hyperparameters across various machine learning algorithms. The result was a predictive model with an accuracy of 87%, demonstrating strong performance on the test dataset. This project highlights the effective application of machine learning techniques to real-world data for accurate price prediction in the real estate market.
